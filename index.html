        GitHub is basically a huge repository collection that has a Web-based
        graphical interface. For beginners, who are still confused about what a
        repository means, you can think of it as a large coding community that
        has numerous contributors all over the world. These contributors work
        together on various projects on this platform known as GitHub. Apart
        from coding enthusiasts, I think that every individual who has a knack
        for computers, IT, software projects, or other such things must know
        about GitHub. If you want to work as a team to develop a simple web
        page, youâ€™ll need several developers who have expertise in different
        fields such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Docker, etc. GitHub
        enables the team to work together simultaneously and build-up one
        project easily in less time and hustle. Developers can contribute from
        any part of the world just by logging in.

        Skills are the expertise or talent needed in order to do a job or task.
        ... There are many different types of skills that can help you succeed
        at all aspects of your life whether it's school, work, or even a sport
